I am an **Assistant Professor in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering @ Purdue University**. I am broadly interested in research spanning software verification, programming languages, and software engineering, especially research aimed at making verification techniques and progamming languages more usable and scalable. My goal is to make it easier for developers to create more secure, higher-quality software!
<!--(This work is becoming increasingly important as more developers use tools like ChatGPT or CoPilot to generate code and must ensure such code is correct/bug free.)-->

**My main line of work is on *gradual verification***, which smoothly and seamlessly combines static (compile time) and dynamic (run time) verification techniques to support the incremental specification and verification of code. I make advancements in gradual verification by taking a holistic approach to research; that is, I explore new techniques, designs, and features using mathematical formalizations, theories, and proofs, user studies, and through engineering and building related tools. If you are curious about my research projects in this space, check out the [projects page](/projects/) of my website.

**I am currently hiring PhD students!** If you are interested in doing research with me, feel free to reach out. I am looking for students with a strong potential to conduct independent research (after some training). No direct experience with verification/programming languages techniques is necessary, but a strong background and interest in CS, SE, HCI, and/or Mathematics is preferred.
<!--PhD applicants who would like to work with me at minimum need to: 1) have some interest in mathematical logic and software engineering, 2) have some interest in at least one of the following: theory work, software development, or user studies/HCI/CS education, and 3) have programming experience equivalent to someone with a BS in CS. If you are unsure whether you meet these requirements or not, feel free to reach out to me and ask. We will figure out together whether or not this is a good fit. -->

I graduated with my **PhD in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in December 2023**, where I was co-advised by [Dr. Jonathan Aldrich](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./aldrich/) and [Dr. Joshua Sunshine](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/). My dissertation focused on gradual verification technology for recursive heap data structures. During my PhD, I was a Google PhD Fellow, NSF GRFP Fellow, and 2022 Rising Star in EECS. I also hold a **BS in Mathematics and Computer Science from Youngstown State University (YSU)**. Previously, I interned at IBM Research, the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and the Software Engineering Research and Empirical Studies Lab at YSU. I also previously contributed to the language designs of [Penrose](https://penrose.cs.cmu.edu/siggraph20)—which generates diagrams from mathematical prose—and [Obsidian](https://obsidian-lang.com/)—a programming language that facilitates the development of secure blockchain applications.

**On a personal note,** I am married to my wonderful husband, Michael DiVincenzo, and we have two adorable cats Cosmo and Zuko. We hope to get a third. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, reading manga, watching anime, and bowling.
